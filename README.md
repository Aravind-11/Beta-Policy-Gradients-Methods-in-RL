## Running the code

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Gym

Running the main file

To run the main file, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will execute the main file and run the reinforcement learning algorithm on the specified environment.

### File structure

The code is split into the following files:

* main.py: This is the main file that contains the code for running the reinforcement learning algorithm.
* functions.py: This file contains the definitions of the policy, gradients, and update_parameters_with_adam functions.
* unn.py, vnn.py, Adam.py, baseline.py: These files contain additional functions and classes used in the main file.

### Additional notes

Make sure that all of the required files are in the same directory, and that the file paths specified in the main file are correct.
